Import categories and products

Given two xml files which contains data of categories and producs import them into a database based on the following rules and mappings:

Category table consists of fields: id (required), parentId (required), name (required), order, image
Product table consists of fields: id (autoincrement), number (required), type (required), name, description, active
The table which stores connection between categories and products consists of fields: id(autoincrement), categoryId (required), productNumber (required), order, visible
Price table consists of fields: id, productNumber (required), grossPrice (required), priceNet (required), amount

Categories (import_category.xml)
- import all items which have node <action> with value import

Mapping xml node to db table field
id = id
parentId = parentId
categoryName = name
sortNumber = order
image = image

Images are stored in image folder.

Products (import_product.xml)
- import all items which have node <action> with value import

Mapping xml node to db table field
orderNumber = number
type = type
name = name
description = description
status = active

Connection between categories and products is given by <categoryRelations> node. 

Mapping xml node to db table field
categoryId = categoryId 
productNumber = orderNumber
order = sortOrderCategory
visible = visible

Product prices are stored in a separate table, which store data from <price> node

Mapping xml node to db table field
productNumber = orderNumber
grossPrice = grossPrice
priceNet = priceNet
amount = amount

Hints:
1. Create a cli command for every import file
2. Store categories images in /public folder and make them accessible from public.



3. List all categories name and all assigned active products numbers and names to the respective category in descending order. The relation between a category and a product should be active also.
4. List all ids of not found categories on product import.
5. Find how many visible products has category "Dinghy und Jolle" which has price bigger than 200.
